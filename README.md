Joon Park's Module 1 Challenge Assignment - Refactoring style.css and index.html with semantic html and corresponding css selectors

* index.html was edited to use semantic html elements (e.g. header, main, article, footer, etc.) rather than div.

* style.css was edited to use element selectors corresponding to the semantic html elements used.

* index.html and style.css was cleaned up of redundant selectors (e.g. used .benefits article to edit the appearance of all three items in the sidebar rather than use three separate classes).

* A broken link to the "Search Engine Optimization" section was fixed.

* Uploaded smaller versions of "online-reputation-management.jpg", "search-engine-optimization.jpg", and "social-media-marketing.jpg" since the original files were much larger than necessary

* Uploaded a slightly lower quality version of "digital-marketing-meeting.jpg" to increase the loading speed of the page without sacrificing quality of the photo.

* Uploaded a screenshot in /images
